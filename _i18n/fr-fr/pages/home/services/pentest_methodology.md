1. <b>Pre-engagement</b> - Cette première étape consiste à définir le périmètre des tests en termes de dates, de cibles et de types d'attaques. L'objectif est de générer un document appelé le Penetration Test Agreement (PTA), où toutes les parties prenantes approuvent les modalité des tests qui seront conduits.
2. <b>Reconnaissance</b> - Once the document has been signed by all concerned parties, the tests will begin with a reconnassance phase where the auditor will gather as much information as possible on the target, in order to decide how they will attack their targets.
3. <b>Attacks</b> - This is the actual testing
4. <b>Report</b> -
