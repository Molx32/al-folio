## Context
At the time of the discovery, I worked as a subcontractor for a retail company as a security analyst to handle security incidents. In order to generate and manage those security incident, the company subscribed to a SOC service proposed by <b>REDACTED</b>. Initialy, <b>REDACTED</b> was not a security company, and their current website doesn't even mention their cybersecurity services, yet they are spread accross many companies with their cybersecurity services, at least in France.

To make it simple, I had an Azure AD (Entra ID) created on my customer tenant, and then this account was synced to <b>REDACTED</b> tenant. Note that is this not an Azure B2B relationship as there is no SSO here : I had different passwords to connect to my customer account or the <b>REDACTED</b> one. Anyways, with this synchronization, I had access to the incident platform and was able to do my job.

All the vulnerabilities that I will describe below requires to be authenticated as a member of the REDACTED directory, which represent thousands of people (subcontractors, partners, customers).

## Security issues
#### First case - Incident platform
The first time I accessed the incident platform, I decided to hunt for bugs. The most critical scenario would be to access <b>REDACTED</b> other customers data and see all their security incidents, but (un)fortunately, I wasn't able to achieve that. After a few minutes, I took a look at my profile and saw that I could access any profile picture with a URL that looked like this : <code>https://incidentplatform.redacted.com/secure/useravatar?ownerId=JIRAUSER12345</code> : a basic IDOR that allowed me to access a vast amount of profile picture (without EXIF data), making <b>REDACTED</b> not GDPR-compliant, since users were not informed that their personal information (their face in that case) would be shared between all <b>REDACTED</b> customers.

#### Second case - Integrify
##### User enumeration
After writing a short report about the previous issue, I spent a lot of time looking for an appropriate email address such as security@<b>redacted</b>.com, which lead me to use Google dorks. By Google dorking about this company, I found various subdomains and web applications, and I decided to hunt for more bugs! I discovered a subdomain hosting an [Integrify](https://www.integrify.com) instance, which is an application dedicated to workflows as far as I can tell. I didn't try to understand the application business at first, and I simply noticed that a feature allowed me to send messages to people, and thus to search for people in a directory.

  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_enum_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
</div>

After some guessing and research, I was able to identify a second API endpoint to enumerate users. I don't know what's the difference between the two, but the first one returns <b>94k users</b>, while the second one returns <b>50k</b>. Among all of these users, mostly are internal people, but many are also subcontractors or customers.

  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_enum_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
</div>

#### Documents enumeration
##### Attachments
When sending messages to people using the application, it is also possible to attach files. So I started scratching there and intercepting requests. As you can see below, this request looks for comments in a specific <b>instance</b> and returns a JSON object containing our comment and attachment. I don't know what an instance is, but having a business knowledge of the application was not my goal since I hadn't much time to spend on it.

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_attachments_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
</div>
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_attachments_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
</div>

The JSON doesn't return any download URL. Instead we only have a SID. In order to get the download URL, we need to use an [API endpoint](https://developer.integrify.com/rest/Files/link), which will redirect to the download URL. As described on the documentation, we need several parameters here :
- <b>owner_type</b>, which will always be set to <b>instance</b>
- <b>owner_sid</b>, which is the instance SID
- <b>object_type</b>, which will always be set to <b>comment</b>
- <b>object_sid</b>, which is the file SID

Actually, when clicking on the attachment and intercepting requests, another undocumented API endpoint is used, and behaves the same way, so we have two entry points the retrieve documents.

Now that we know how to get attachments, we simply need to get the list of all instances, automate that, and it should work! According to the documentation, there is an [API endpoint](https://developer.integrify.com/rest/Instances/instance-monitor-list) that allows to enumerate all instances where the current user has monitor permissions. Let's see what we get by sending a request to it.
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_attachments_7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
</div>

By reading the name of the document, I knew this was juicy stuff. In addition, we have a total of 112k instances, so we probably will get many attachments available.

I wrote a short script that fetches files : 
{% highlight python %}
import requests
import json

# Sanitized short list of instances which contains attachments
instance_ids = [
    "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    # ... ,
    "12345678-4321-4321-4321-123456789012"
]

# Iterate over all instances
for instance_id in instance_ids:
    # Send request and read response
    url = 'https://redacted.com/napi/instances/' + instance_id + '/comments/'
    cookies = {'iapi_token':'access%26oauth_token%3D123456789%26oauth_token_secret%3D00000'}
    response = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)

    # Just in case
    if not "AttachmentName" in response.text:
        continue

    # Read JSON response (also possible with response.json())
    data = json.loads(response.text)
    for item in data['Items']:
        # Get data, and jump to next iteration if no attachment, we never know
        subject     = item['Subject']
        date        = item['CommentDate']
        attachments = item['Attachments']
        if not attachments:
            continue

        # Iterate over all attachments for a given intsance
        for attachment in attachments:
            name    = attachment['AttachmentName']
            sid     = attachment['AttachmentSID']

            # Write CSV to get a summary
            row = str(instance_id) + '||' + str(subject) + '||' + str(date) + '||' + str(name) + '||' + str(sid) + '\n'
            with open('attachments_table.csv', 'a', encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(row)
            
            # Fetch and store file
            url = 'https://redacted.com/rest-service/files/stream/?owner_sid=' + instance_id + '&owner_type=instance&object_sid=' + sid + '&object_type=comment'
            cookies = {'iapi_token':'access%26oauth_token%3b123456789%26oauth_token_secret%3D00000'}
            response = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
            
            with open('./ATTACHMENTS/' + name, 'wb') as attachment_file:
                attachment_file.write(response.content)
                print("writen")
{% endhighlight %}

Obviously I can't show the results nor describe the content because it would give hints about the company, but what I can tell is that files are PDFs, XLSXs, MSGs, dans DOCXs and very critical.

##### Other documents
A last word about documents : according to [Integrify API documentation](https://developer.integrify.com/rest/Files/list), there are attachment, but there are also files associated to an instance that are not attachments. So let's try to request this endpoint!
Long story short : we simply have the opportunity to download more and more files.

  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/BUGBOUNTY/01/bug_bounty_01_attachments_9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

#### Third case - Azure
Again, while looking for a security email address, I discovered a subdomain with a directory listing with approximately ten directories with only a few that I could access. All the content was identity-related with keywords like SSO, SAML and so on. One of the directories contained a whole C# project folder, including only compiled files :
- https://identity.redacted.com/Folder1/obj/Release/renamed.dll
- https://identity.redacted.com/Folder1/obj/Debug/renamed_debug.dll

I began to look for strings inside the DLL to understand what it is used for, and when parsing printable characters only, I ended up with a string corresponding to Azure AD (actually Entra ID now) Service Principal credentials that are still valid <i>i.e.</i> a tenant ID, a client ID (or application ID) and of course a secret.
<br>
I used Azure CLI to connect to the service principal using the command below, and started recon on Azure.
<br>
<code>az login --service-principal -u '1234abcd-1234-1234-1234-1234abcd1234' -p 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqWQ==' --tenant '1234abcd-4321-4321-4321-1234abcd1234' --allow-no-subscriptions</code>

The service principal was related to a web application that was not accessible, either because of network filtering or because it was retired. Thus, I was not able to do much with it : no subscription available and no directory permissions. The only exploit would be to interact with the web application, but as mentioned, it was not accessible.

## Responsible disclosure
For the first case, I don't remember when I observe that all was properly fixed.
