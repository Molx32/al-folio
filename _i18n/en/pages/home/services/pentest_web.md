The goal of a penetration test in a web environment is usually to become an application administrator, or to get access to data/resources that should be accessible. To achieve that, the auditor/pentester always start to analyze the application to understand how it works and which features were implemented. Once identified, all the features will be tested with multiple attacks such as SQLi, XSS, SSRF and so on.
