</div>

1. <b>Pre-engagement</b> - This first step is a meeting where we define the scope of the tests, in terms of schedule, domains to target, types of attacks and so on. The objective is to generate a contract called the Penetration Test Agreement (PTA) where both clients and auditors agree on the terms of the service that will be realised.
2. <b>Reconnaissance</b> - Once the document has been signed by all concerned parties, the tests will begin with a reconnassance phase where the auditor will gather as much information as possible on the target, in order to decide how they will attack their targets.
3. <b>Attacks</b> - This is the actual testing
4. <b>Report</b> -
