  pentest:
    methodology:
      step1: The <b>pre-engagement</b> phase is a discussion with stakeholders to define the scope, objectives, and critical assets of the infrastructure to be tested. At the end of this first step, stakeholders must sign the <b>Penetration Test Agreement (PTA)</b> that will allow technical tests to start.
      step2: During the <b>test phase</b>, the targeted resources will be subjected to attacks.
      step3: Finally, during the <b>report and presentation</b> phase, auditors will write a detailed report that will be presented to both technical and non-technical people. This is the opportunity for customers to challenge findings and to better understand what has been found.

      list:
      - title: black-box
        description: In black-box pentesting, the tester has no prior knowledge of the system being tested. They approach the application or network just like a real attacker would, using only publicly available information to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. This method simulates an external attack, focusing on discovering security gaps from an outsider's perspective.

      - title: grey-box
        description: Grey-box pentesting involves providing the tester with limited knowledge of the system, such as access credentials or information about the application's architecture. This approach strikes a balance between black-box and white-box testing, allowing the tester to focus on specific areas while still simulating an attacker's perspective. It helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by someone with partial insider knowledge.

      - title: white-box
        description: In white-box pentesting, the tester has full access to detailed information about the system, including source code, architecture diagrams, and internal documentation. This thorough approach allows for an in-depth assessment of the system's security, identifying vulnerabilities at a granular level. White-box testing is ideal for uncovering complex issues that may not be apparent from the outside.

      title: Web Application Pentesting
      subtitle: Uncover and Fix Vulnerabilities in Your Web Apps
      description_detailed: <b>Web pentesting</b>, or <b>web application penetration testing</b>, is a simulated cyberattack on your website or web application to identify security vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them.<br><br>For example, during a web pentest, an expert might check if your website can be tricked into revealing sensitive data like customer information or if someone can gain access using a weak password. They might also see if there are ways for unauthorized users to view or modify parts of your website that should be protected.<br><br>After the test, you'll receive a <b>detailed report</b> that highlights all the vulnerabilities identified, along with recommendations on how to fix them. This helps ensure your web application is secure, protecting your business and your customers from potential threats.

      title: Active Directory & Infrastructure Pentesting
      subtitle: Strengthen Your Network Against Attacks
      description_detailed: An <b>infrastructure pentest</b>, like an Active Directory (AD) pentest, is a simulated attack on your organization’s IT infrastructure to find security weaknesses before cybercriminals do. This type of testing focuses on your internal networks, servers, and critical systems like Active Directory, which manages user access and permissions.<br><br>For example, during an AD pentest, an expert might check if unauthorized users can access sensitive areas of your network by exploiting weak passwords or misconfigured permissions. They may also test how easily an attacker could move through your network if they gain access, ensuring that each layer of your infrastructure is properly secured.<br><br>After the test, you’ll receive a detailed report highlighting all the vulnerabilities found and how to fix them. This helps you strengthen your IT infrastructure, protecting your organization’s data and maintaining the integrity of your operations.

      subtitle: Secure Your Azure/M365 Environment from Cyber Threats
      description_detailed: An <b>Azure/M365 cloud pentest</b> is a simulated attack on your Azure cloud environment to identify security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by cybercriminals. While Azure’s security is managed by Microsoft, misconfigurations on your end can still lead to dangerous vulnerabilities. This type of testing focuses on your cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines, storage, databases, and identity management systems like Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory).<br><br>For example, during an Azure pentest, an expert might check if unauthorized users can gain access to your cloud resources by exploiting weak access controls or misconfigured security settings. They may also test how easily an attacker could move within your cloud environment if they gain access, ensuring that your cloud architecture is properly secured.<br><br>After the test, you’ll receive a detailed report highlighting all the vulnerabilities found and recommendations on how to fix them. This helps you strengthen your Azure cloud security, protecting your data and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
